# ATTiny13A-Solar-Watch

A custom design based on this project: https://github.com/techn0man1ac/PerpetualLEDWristwatch/tree/main

This redesign is meant for use with a 5.5v 0.5-10F supercapacitor. given 10 minutes of sun, it can run for a approximately week with no light when using a 1F supercapacitor.

Slowly charges to about 4v max under strong indoor lighting.
